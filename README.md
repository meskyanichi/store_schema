StoreSchema, for Rails/ActiveRecord 4.0.0+, enhances `ActiveRecord::Base.store_accessor` with data conversion capabilities.

This library was developed for- and extracted from [HireFire].

The documentation can be found on [RubyDoc].


### Compatibility

- Rails/ActiveRecord 4.0.0+
- Ruby (MRI) 2.0+
- Ruby (RBX) 2.2+


### Installation

Distributed at a gem, hosted at [RubyGems.org].

```rb
gem "store_schema"
```


### Example

This example assumes you have a `websites` table with a column named
`config` of type `text`.

Define a model and use `store_schema`.

```rb
class Website < ActiveRecord::Base

  # Tell ActiveRecord that we want to serialize the :config attribute
  # and store the serialized data as text in the config column.
  #
  # If you're using PostreSQL's "hstore" column-type instead of the
  # "text" column-type, you don't have to define `serialize :config`.
  #
  serialize :config

  # Define a schema for the store. This syntax is similar to
  # ActiveRecord::Migration.
  #
  store_schema :config do |s|
    s.string :name
    s.integer :visitors
    s.float :apdex
    s.boolean :ssl
    s.datetime :published_at
  end
end
```

Now you can get and set attributes on the `websites.config` column using
the generated accessors.

```rb
website = Website.create(
  name: "Example Website",
  visitors: 1337,
  apdex: 1.0,
  ssl: true,
  published_at: Time.now
)

p website.name # => "Example Website" (String)
p website.visitors # => 1337 (Fixnum)
p website.apdex # => 1.0 (Float)
p website.ssl # => true (TrueClass)
p website.published_at # => "Thu, 18 Sep 2014 23:18:11 +0000" (DateTime)

p website.config
# =>
# {
#   "name" => "Example Website",
#   "visitors" => "1337",
#   "apdex" => "1.0",
#   "ssl" => "t",
#   "published_at" => "2014-09-18 23:18:11.583168000"
# }
```

That's it. This is similar to just using `store_accessor`, except that
`store_schema` is more strict as to what data types are stored. It attempts
to stay consistent with ActiveRecord's column conventions such as storing
booleans (`0`, `"0"`, `1`, `"1"`, `"t"`, `"T"`, `"f"`, `"F"`, `true`,
`"true"`, `"TRUE"`, `false`, `"false"`, `"FALSE"`, `"on"`, `"ON"`, `"off"`,
`"OFF"`) as `"t"` and `"f"`, storing `Time`, `Date` as `DateTime`,
ensuring `Time` is UTC prior to being stored, and more.

When accessing stored data, it properly converts them to their data types.
For example, `"t"` is converted to a TrueClass, and
`"2014-09-18 23:18:11.583168000"` is converted back to a DateTime.
See above example.

If you need to be able to query these serialized attributes,
consider using [PostgreSQL's HStore Extension]. If you do not need to
be able to query the serialized data, you can simply use a text-type column
and use the `serialize` method in your model which works with any SQL database.
